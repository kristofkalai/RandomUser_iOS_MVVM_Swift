# RandomUser_iOS_MVVM
A small app to demonstrate the MVVM architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for the networking (it can be replaced by a [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) layer if you are interested), [SDWebImageSwiftUI](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI) for the images. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with the newest SwiftUI framework and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple MVVM architectural pattern in practice. If you are interested you can take a look at my other repos as well.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
