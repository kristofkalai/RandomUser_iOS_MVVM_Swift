# RandomUser_iOS_MVVM_Swift
A small app (written in Swift) to demonstrate the MVVM architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries:
- networking: [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), [Just](https://github.com/dduan/Just)
- dependency injection: [Swinject](https://github.com/Swinject/Swinject)
- images: [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher), [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage), [FetchImage](https://github.com/kean/FetchImage) ([Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke)-based)
- persistence: [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa)
- transitions: [DisplayLink](https://github.com/timdonnelly/DisplayLink), [SwiftUIPullToRefresh](https://github.com/phuhuynh2411/SwiftUI-PullToRefresh), [SkeletonUI](https://github.com/CSolanaM/SkeletonUI)
- animations: [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)
- standard: [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui), [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine)

The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with the newest SwiftUI framework and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple MVVM architectural pattern in practice. If you are interested you can take a look at my other repos as well.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests and previews will be coming in the near future.
