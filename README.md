# RandomUser_iOS_MVVM
A small app to demonstrate the MVVM architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) for the networking, [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher), [SDWebImageSwiftUI](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI) and [FetchImage](https://github.com/kean/FetchImage) ([Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke)-based) for the images, [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) for the persistence, [DisplayLink](https://github.com/timdonnelly/DisplayLink), [SwiftUIPullToRefresh](https://github.com/phuhuynh2411/SwiftUI-PullToRefresh) and [SkeletonUI](https://github.com/CSolanaM/SkeletonUI) for the transitions, and [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) for the animations. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles. It's made by the use of XCode 11+, Swift 5+, iOS 13+ with the newest SwiftUI framework and SPM (Swift Package Manager). The main goal is to show a really simple MVVM architectural pattern in practice. If you are interested you can take a look at my other repos as well.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
